# Project Setup Instructions

To set up and run the project, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the root of the project and install dependencies for the `abc`
   module:

   ```bash
   cd abc && npm install && cd ..
   ```

2. Once the dependencies are installed, navigate to the `deno-app` directory and
   start the project:

   ```bash
   cd deno-app && deno task run
   ```

This will start the Deno application.
